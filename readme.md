# QR Code Generator

A JavaScript app engineered using qrcode.js library of and designed using Tailwind CSS.

It is stage 1 of the full scale projects aims to solve the problem of not knowing the expiry date of medicines.

Problem: Medicinal Tablet packs usually has Expiry date only printed on the whole pack and hence if you buy a piece of that tablet and see it after a week, you may not know the name of the tablet or most importantly its Expiry date.

Solution: Our aim is to put a QR on each individual tablet so that all one has to do is to scan the QR to know everything about the Tablet from MFG By to Expiry Date to Lot number.
